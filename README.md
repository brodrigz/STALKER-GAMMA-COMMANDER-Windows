## What this fork adds

- Managed xrRazom co-op: verified Slim download, a separate MO2 profile, reversible engine switching, update recovery and repair. Session settings, friend comparison and adoption are hidden pending validation.
- Full Windows support, including portable package.
- Support for existing GAMMA installations and MO2 profiles through our [custom CLI](https://github.com/brodrigz/stalker-gamma-cli).
- Replaces obsolete modpack API URLs with the official GitHub catalogue while preserving custom sources.
- Per-addon download progress and speed, pause/resume, and resizable panels.
- Independent download and extraction slots, retries during the batch, and explicit waiting/failure states.
- Publisher-based archive and installed-file verification, with a separate Local MD5 Check for personal snapshots. Repairs target damaged addons, reuse healthy archives and verified source hashes, and recheck repaired files and shared patches.
- Cloudflare status and browser verification on demand, with resumable downloads.
- Persistent Windows tray: minimize or close keeps downloads running; right-click the tray icon and choose Exit to quit. Notifications report completed installs/updates and required Cloudflare verification, with a persistent in-app warning.

Windows is the supported target; Linux compatibility is not maintained.

## Build a portable Windows package

Run `./package.ps1` in PowerShell. It builds the current launcher source, including uncommitted changes, with the CLI revision pinned in `cli/windows-backend.json`, runs smoke checks before and after ZIP extraction, and writes the portable ZIP and SHA-256 checksum to a new `dist/releases/portable-<timestamp>/` folder. The full ZIP path is printed when finished. Use `./package.ps1 -OutputDirectory C:\Builds\Commander` for a custom destination.

First-time build setup: install Python 3.10 x64, run `./scripts/Setup-Windows.ps1`, then `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-build-windows.txt`. CLI changes must be committed and the pinned revision updated to include them in a package. This command builds locally; it does not publish a release.

## GAMMA co-op (xrRazom)

Open **Co-op** with your normal GAMMA profile selected, then choose **Download and install Slim 1.4** or select the official Slim ZIP. Commander prompts for a separate MO2 Co-op profile name (default `G.A.M.M.A. Co-op`), verifies the publisher MD5, copies your single-player mod selection and order, and enables xrRazom at highest priority. The current MO2 Anomaly plugin shares saves between profiles; use distinct single-player and co-op save names. Adopting an existing co-op profile is temporarily disabled; a manually installed co-op engine must first be restored to the GAMMA engine so a valid single-player backup can be made.

Commander profiles have separate **MO2 profile** and **MO2 Co-op profile** settings. New installations leave the Co-op profile unset until setup. The startup update check runs once per app session; manual checks remain available. Installation controls are hidden after setup, and Remove co-op requires confirmation.

Choose **Activate co-op**, then **Play co-op**. The button requires the co-op engine to be active and the configured Co-op profile to exist with xrRazom enabled at highest priority; it uses the normal MO2 launch flow. The Play tab also warns whenever co-op binaries are active. Set your player name, role and connection in-game under Settings > xrRazom Co-op. Launcher session controls are hidden; their code is retained as comments until validated. Keep your name unchanged to retain your identity on the host. Steam must be running for Steam sessions (everyone needs Call of Pripyat), and closed for LAN sessions. Use **Switch to single-player** to restore the backed-up engine and original profile. Close Anomaly and MO2 before changing modes. The bottom status bar shows the active MO2 profile and provides Change profile; its tooltip identifies the Commander configuration profile.

Commander temporarily restores the GAMMA engine during its updates/repairs, refreshes the single-player backups afterward and reapplies co-op. Failed maintenance blocks launch until a successful retry. Use **Recover interrupted setup** after an interrupted co-op transaction, or **Repair co-op** to restore managed files from the verified package. **Remove co-op** keeps the co-op profile and saves. Backups and the retained package are stored under the Commander's CLI settings directory in `coop/`, outside the GAMMA installation. After an external launcher update, run a GAMMA update/repair through Commander to refresh its engine backups before reapplying co-op.

**Verify Integrity** checks managed co-op payload against the authenticated package, including intentional Anomaly engine replacements. **Play with the same mods** is hidden pending validation; use the game's connection check to identify mismatches. **Read connection mismatches** shows `xrRazom cfg-diff` entries from the newest game log. This integration pins Slim 1.4; it does not install Full Bundle options or disable the game's mod compatibility check.

## What this is

GAMMA is a huge S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly mod pack, normally installed through a Windows launcher and run through Mod Organizer 2. On Linux, the community solution is [FaithBeam/stalker-gamma-cli](https://github.com/FaithBeam/stalker-gamma-cli) — an excellent but entirely terminal-driven installer.

**COMMANDER is a desktop GUI around that CLI.** It doesn't reimplement any installer logic — it drives the real `stalker-gamma` binary as a subprocess and parses its output live. Every download, checksum and extraction is performed by the upstream CLI, so results are identical to using it by hand; you just get progress tables, a mod manager, prefix handling and a Play button instead of a terminal.

On top of the CLI, COMMANDER adds things it doesn't do on its own: launching through Mod Organizer 2 in a Wine/Proton prefix, a GE-Proton installer, a `modlist.txt` editor, dependency setup, and a full integrity check & repair pass.

---

## Features

### Dashboard
The landing page. Shows the active profile, install status for Anomaly and GAMMA, a live dependency count, storage usage across your Anomaly/GAMMA/cache folders, and a background check for GAMMA addon updates. Quick-open buttons jump straight to the Anomaly, GAMMA, cache and log folders, and a **Play GAMMA** shortcut launches the game without leaving the page.

### Install
Installs S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly and GAMMA with a **live per-addon progress table** (name, operation, percent) and an overall completion bar. Pick a base folder and hit **Create folders** to auto-generate the Anomaly/GAMMA/cache layout.

<img width="1342" height="1010" alt="2-install" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bacd6e10-0645-4b80-a3f7-819fc8630254" />

- If a download is interrupted, the next launch offers **Resume GAMMA Installation** — cached archives are hash-verified and reused, only missing or changed ones are re-downloaded.
- **Minimal mode** deletes addon archives after extraction to save ~50 GB of disk space.
- **Preserve user.ltx / Preserve MCM settings** checkboxes protect your keybindings, game options and mod configs across a reinstall.
- **Install Dependencies** sets up everything MO2 and the game need in one click: `umu-run`, `protontricks` (via `pipx` on PEP 668 systems), and eight Visual C++/DirectX runtimes (`d3dcompiler_43`, `d3dcompiler_47`, `d3dx10`, `d3dx11_43`, `d3dx9`, `quartz`, `dx8vb`, `vcrun2022`) — installed through the selected runner's own Wine (`umu-run winetricks` for GE-Proton, the runner's `wine` binary otherwise), never the system `winetricks`/`wine` on PATH. Running a different Wine build against a Proton prefix corrupts its system DLLs and makes the game crash-loop on launch; COMMANDER now refuses to do that.

### Play
Launch GAMMA through Mod Organizer 2, open MO2 directly, or run Anomaly's executable without the MO2 virtual file system. Targets are read straight from `ModOrganizer.ini`, with `AnomalyLauncher.exe` used as a fallback if none are found.

<img width="1342" height="1010" alt="3-play" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb91b2e0-6422-4517-bd1f-f9a3cd401fbe" />


- **Auto runner detection** — the newest installed GE-Proton build is picked automatically and launched through `umu-run`.
- **Built-in GE-Proton installer** — browse recent GE-Proton releases, download with a progress bar and cancel support, and COMMANDER verifies the SHA-512 checksum and installs it into `compatibilitytools.d` for you. No manual downloading or extracting.
- **Per-runner prefixes** — each runner remembers its own Wine prefix, so switching runners never corrupts a prefix built by a different version.
- A live command preview with a copy button, a custom launch options field (supports env vars like `PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1`), and status chips showing installed GE-Proton builds, GameMode and MangoHud.
- The game launches **detached** — closing COMMANDER doesn't kill your session — with output captured to a rotating `launcher.log`. Failed launches are diagnosed automatically: a DXVK/Vulkan problem, a runner/prefix mismatch, or the classic `concrt140.dll` error are called out by name instead of surfacing a raw Wine crash, with a one-click option to bundle a bug report on the spot.
- One-click **desktop shortcuts** that launch a specific target with the currently selected runner.
- **Total playtime** is tracked per profile and shown on the Dashboard.
- Optional **Discord Rich Presence** ("Playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. GAMMA" with your mod count and total playtime) — off by default; one checkbox in Settings turns it on, no Discord developer setup needed.

### Updates
Compares your installed GAMMA version and addon list against the latest official data — without hitting the rate-limited GitHub REST API — and shows exactly what changed: Added, Modified, Removed, and archive-name changes.

<img width="1342" height="1010" alt="4-update" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d54ad35-921d-46be-9501-454b8d8a2137" />

Applying updates reuses the same live progress UI as a fresh install, respects the Minimal/preserve-settings options, and holds the global install lock so it can never run alongside another install. A **background check runs at most once a day** even if you never open this page, with a desktop notification if one is found. If an update doesn't go well, **Undo Last Update** restores the `modlist.txt` snapshot taken right before it was applied.

### Mod Manager
Direct, careful editing of the active MO2 profile's `modlist.txt` — search, enable/disable, delete and reorder mods, grouped by the `_separator` categories GAMMA ships.

<img width="1342" height="1010" alt="5-modmanager" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebfc0f97-bcdd-447e-a81b-5bd66e4df603" />

- **Drag-and-drop reordering** with multi-selection support, plus Move Up/Down.
- **Reversed load order detection**: a GAMMA load order that has been flipped end to end (which crashes the game on startup) is flagged in the Mod Manager and before launching, with a one-click fix.
- Create new categories, install a local ZIP/7Z/RAR/FOMOD mod archive straight into the modlist, and use the active profile as MO2's selected profile without opening MO2.
- **A backup is taken automatically before your first edit** (`modlist.txt.gammagui.bak`) and can be restored from the UI, alongside a **Restore Original Order** option.
- **Writes are atomic** — a crash or full disk cannot truncate your load order — and **edits are blocked while Mod Organizer is running**, since MO2 rewrites the file on exit and would silently discard them.
- **Check for File Conflicts** scans every enabled mod's files for ones shared by more than one mod, so you can see what the current load order is actually overriding.
- Press **Ctrl+F** anywhere in the app to jump straight to this page's search box.

### Verify Integrity & Repair
Checks Anomaly files and mod presence, retrieves ModDB archive hashes, and compares installed files against verified archives and the configured GitHub sources, applying GAMMA patch precedence. Requires internet access and retained ModDB archives; missing references, rate limits, or unsupported sources produce an incomplete result, never a clean verdict. User settings and extra files are excluded. Differences can mean edits or newer source versions as well as corruption. Local verification uses up to three workers (bounded by the profile�s download-thread setting), while ModDB metadata requests stay paced. Shared archives are checked and extracted once per scan.

**Local MD5 Check** is a separate pane for creating/checking a personal snapshot. Its first run records existing files and cannot detect pre-existing corruption. Source verification never creates or refreshes that snapshot.

If a broken mod matches an entry in the official GAMMA mod list, COMMANDER can **repair it automatically and non-destructively**: the mod folder and its cached archive are set aside (not deleted), then it's redownloaded and MD5-verified against the official checksum. If the reinstall fails or is cancelled, the set-aside copies are restored automatically — nothing is permanently lost until a repair is confirmed successful. Your own added mods and files are never touched, and anything with no known download source is reported instead of touched.

### Profiles
Create, edit, activate and delete CLI profiles — each with its own Anomaly, GAMMA, cache, MO2 profile, download-thread and repository settings. Creation, activation and deletion are delegated to `stalker-gamma config` so its side effects (MO2's `selected_profile`, modlist downloads) happen exactly as the CLI intends. Advanced fields expose every repo URL and branch the CLI supports, for anyone using a fork or mirror.

- **Export/Import Profile** saves a profile's portable settings (and its `modlist.txt`, if installed) to a file you can back up or hand to a friend — install folders are always chosen fresh on import, since they're specific to each machine.

### System Check
Checks every dependency GAMMA and MO2 need in one place: the CLI, Wine, Winetricks, Protontricks, `umu-run`, Vulkan (including the 32-bit loader), each individual Winetricks runtime, GE-Proton builds, GameMode and MangoHud. Every check shows its status and a copyable install command for your distro, and manual overrides let you point COMMANDER at tools installed in non-standard locations.

<img width="1342" height="1010" alt="6-systemcheck" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/425ffc07-522d-4a52-a611-3dc0e7c46a4f" />

### Utilities
A toolbox for maintenance and recovery:

<img width="1342" height="1010" alt="7-utilities" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/114caa0d-24a3-4d56-a38f-c2c1b1890221" />

- **Cache cleanup** — preview which archives are out of date and how much space they'll free, then clean them.
- **Clear shader cache** and **Remove ReShade** for a clean slate after driver or mod changes.
- **Fix GOG installation** — repairs `ModOrganizer.ini` paths for a GOG-provided copy of Anomaly.
- **Repair Wine prefix** — restores the runner's own system DLLs if another Wine has written into the game's prefix (the symptom: every launch immediately crash-loops and can exhaust system memory). COMMANDER also refuses to launch into a prefix it detects as damaged, so this shouldn't come up in normal use — it exists for prefixes touched by something outside COMMANDER (a manual `winetricks`/`wine` command, another launcher). Reinstall dependencies afterward, since verb-installed runtimes are among the files a foreign Wine would have overwritten.
- **Move installation** — copy Anomaly, GAMMA and cache to another drive, verified before the originals are deleted. An interrupted move is safely detected and resumed on the next launch.
- **Create Log Dump** and **Export Diagnostics** — bundle logs, settings and system info into one archive for bug reports.
- **Fresh Reset**, **GAMMA Reset** and **Full Uninstall** — guarded destructive actions that show exactly what will be deleted and what's kept (your Wine prefix always survives) before doing anything.
- Opens the bundled **COMMANDER ASSISTANT** log analyzer directly from the page.

<img width="1178" height="735" alt="8-assistant" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca097673-6b6f-4c5b-92d5-b14632568efb" />

### Settings
- **10 languages** — English, French, Spanish, German, Romanian, Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Portuguese and Turkish. Switch anytime; it applies instantly with no restart, unless a background task is running.
- **6 themes** — GAMMA, GAMMA Black, Dusk, Midnight, Terminal and Reactor, each with its own color palette.
- Interface font family (6 options) and size (9–22 px), both applied live.
- Startup page, default runner, an "Always use GameMode" toggle, an Open Winecfg shortcut, and MO2 Display Scale presets (100–200%) for readable text in Mod Organizer.
- Desktop autostart, launching COMMANDER automatically on login.
- **Add to Steam** — writes COMMANDER and Deck Mode straight into your Steam library as non-Steam games, no manual "Add a Non-Steam Game" dialog needed.


### Steam Deck Mode

A second interface built for the Deck's 1280x800 screen, its controls and its
touchscreen. Open it from the small Steam Deck icon on the **Dashboard**, next
to *Quick actions* — COMMANDER closes and reopens in Deck Mode. **Exit Deck
Mode**, on Deck Mode's Settings screen (or the ☰ Menu button), brings you back
the same way.

- **First-run setup.** With no profile yet, Deck Mode asks one question —
  internal storage or SD card — and creates the profile for you, then sends
  you to Install.
- Tabs, in handheld order: **Dashboard · Play · Mods · Update · Install ·
  Utilities · System · Settings**.
- **Dashboard** answers "can I play?" in one banner with the one button that
  moves things forward (Play, Install, Resume, Update), with playtime right
  under it, then Anomaly · GAMMA · Dependencies side by side, updates, mods,
  storage, and your **profiles**: switch, create, or edit a profile's name
  and its Anomaly / GAMMA / cache folders with a built-in folder browser.
- **Play** (launch target, runner, session timer, and **Force Stop Game** for
  a game that hangs — the Deck has no Alt+F4), **Mods** (the desktop Mod
  Manager's category tree as a full-screen list, in MO2 order with priority
  numbers; fold categories, filter, search, enable/disable a whole category),
  **Update** (every added / modified / removed mod, plus scrollable patch
  notes), **Install** (Anomaly, GAMMA, dependencies, GE-Proton, install
  options, and **Resume** after an interrupted install), **Utilities** (cache,
  shader cache, ReShade, GOG fix, prefix repair, move install, log dump, and
  the Uninstall / Reinstall resets), **System** check (with a *Copy install
  command* button on each missing item) and **Settings**.
- **Handheld-aware.** The Deck is kept awake while an install, update or move
  runs, you're warned before a long download on battery, the header shows
  the battery, and the footer shows the active profile and the time.
- **Any screen size.** On the Deck it fills the panel; on a bigger window —
  maximised on a monitor, or docked to a TV — the whole interface scales up
  with it.

**Controls.** The controller works in Game Mode out of the box — COMMANDER
reads the gamepad directly, so Steam's default layout is fine — and in
Desktop Mode's keyboard layout as well:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| D-pad / left stick | Move (hold to repeat) |
| A | Select / toggle |
| B | Back |
| X | The screen's main action (below) |
| Y | The screen's second action / search |
| L1 / R1 | Previous / next tab |
| L2 / R2 | Page up / down |
| ☰ Menu | Exit Deck Mode or quit |
| ⧉ View | Controls help |

| Screen | X | Y |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | What the banner says (Play / Install / Resume / Update) | Re-check |
| Play | Play GAMMA (Force Stop while running) | Open MO2 |
| Mods | Category menu | Search |
| Update | Check / Apply updates | Show changes |
| Install | Install or resume GAMMA | Install dependencies |
| System | Re-check | — |

The ☰ Menu button opens a quick menu from anywhere: **Play GAMMA**, **Exit
Deck Mode** or **Quit**.

Text fields have a built-in on-screen keyboard (Y), touch works everywhere
(tap to select, drag to scroll), and every screen shows its buttons in the
footer. All six themes and all ten languages work as they do on the desktop,
and the text size has its own 80–150% scale.

On a real Steam Deck, COMMANDER offers Deck Mode the first time it starts and
remembers your answer (changeable later under **Settings → When COMMANDER
starts**); in Game Mode it opens Deck Mode without asking. On any other machine it
opens as an ordinary 1280x800 window, so you can try it out.

**Adding Deck Mode to Steam** so it works in Game Mode: in Desktop Mode, use
**Add COMMANDER to Steam** (desktop **Settings → Steam**, or Deck Mode's
**Settings**) —
this writes both **STALKER COMMANDER** and **STALKER COMMANDER DECK**
straight into your Steam library. If Steam is running it is closed first,
the shortcuts are written, and Steam is started again. If you'd rather do it by hand,
or the button can't tell which Steam account to use, the manual route still
works:

- *AUR / from source*: in Desktop Mode, **Add a Non-Steam Game** and pick
  **STALKER COMMANDER (Deck Mode)**.
- *AppImage*: add the `.AppImage` itself, then set its launch options to
  `--deck`. An AppImage can only publish one desktop entry, so the Deck one
  cannot ride along with it.

Deck Mode full-screens itself under gamescope, which has no window manager to
size a window for it.

---

## Installation

### AppImage (recommended)

Download the latest `.AppImage` from [**Releases**](https://github.com/SSH-Kitty/STALKER-GAMMA-COMMANDER/releases):

```bash
chmod +x STALKER-GAMMA-COMMANDER-*-x86_64.AppImage
./STALKER-GAMMA-COMMANDER-*-x86_64.AppImage
```

Python, Qt and the CLI are all bundled inside. For a menu entry and icon, use [Gear Lever](https://github.com/mijorus/gearlever) or [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).

### Arch Linux

A `PKGBUILD` is provided under [`packaging/aur/`](packaging/aur/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSH-Kitty/STALKER-GAMMA-COMMANDER.git
cd STALKER-GAMMA-COMMANDER/packaging/aur
makepkg -si
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SSH-Kitty/STALKER-GAMMA-COMMANDER.git
cd STALKER-GAMMA-COMMANDER
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` creates a `.venv/`, installs PySide6, and launches the app. The `stalker-gamma` CLI is already bundled at `cli/usr/bin/stalker-gamma`.

Add `--deck` to start straight in [Steam Deck Mode](#steam-deck-mode):
`./run.sh --deck`.

**`run.sh` allows several instances at once**, so you can run two builds side
by side while developing. Every extra window says `[extra instance]` in its
title bar — they all share `~/.config/stalker-gamma`, so their settings writes
are last-write-wins, and nothing stops two of them starting an install into
the same folders. Use `COMMANDER_ALLOW_MULTIPLE=0 ./run.sh` for the shipped
behaviour. The AppImage and the AUR package are unaffected: both still refuse
a second instance, and the AppImage does so even if the variable is exported
in the shell that launches it.

### Running the tests

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

The Qt platform has to be set on the command line — the suite builds real
widgets, and there is no `pytest.ini` to hold the variable.

---

## First run

1. **Profiles** → set your Anomaly, GAMMA and Cache folders (use absolute paths) and create the profile — it activates automatically.
2. **Install** → **Install GAMMA**. Anomaly is installed first if it's missing. Expect a large download: ~150 GB, or ~100 GB with Minimal mode.
3. **Install → Install Dependencies** — sets up the Wine/Proton runtimes MO2 needs.
4. **Play** → pick a runner and launch target, then **Launch Game**.

Use **Updates** for addon updates afterward, and **Verify Integrity** if something seems broken.

---

## Contributing a translation

Adding a new language is copy-and-fill-in, no code changes needed: start
from [`commander_gui/locales/template.py`](commander_gui/locales/template.py),
which lists every translatable string in the app. See the instructions
in that file's header for the exact steps.
