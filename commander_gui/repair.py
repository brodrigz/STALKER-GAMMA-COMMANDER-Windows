"""Auto-repair helpers for GAMMA mod integrity verification.

Given the failures reported by an MD5 scan (``integrity.scan_mods_md5``),
these helpers figure out which mods can be re-downloaded and re-extracted
through the official modpack list, and prepare the install for repair:
the corrupt mod folder and its cached archive are deleted so a subsequent
``full install --skip-extract-on-hash-match`` re-downloads (MD5-verified
against the official archive checksum) and re-extracts just those mods.

    genuine Microsoft ``msvcp140.dll`` from a winetricks verb both differ
    from Proton's builtins and both belong exactly where they are.

    Returns ``(prefix_file, runner_replacement)`` pairs; the replacement is
    the same-named DLL from the runner's ``files/lib/wine/<arch>-windows``,

    Proton copies a set of its DLLs into ``system32``/``syswow64`` as real
    files. If a different Wine build has run in the prefix since, its own
    versions of those files are sitting there instead, and Proton - which
    tracks them by name, not content - loads them and crashes on the first
    thread of every process.

    Every DLL :func:`foreign_prefix_dlls` identifies is replaced with the
    runner's copy; one the runner does not ship is removed, so Proton's own
    placeholder logic takes over on the next launch. Nothing else in the
    prefix is touched: not the registry, not ``winetricks.log``, not any
    third-party DLL.

    One consequence the caller must relay: runtimes a winetricks verb had
    installed (``vcrun2022``'s ``msvcp140.dll`` among them) were overwritten
    by the other Wine too, so they come back as Proton's builtins and the
