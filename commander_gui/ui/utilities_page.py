#: System directories that must never be handed to rmtree, whatever a

#: under one of them, not just on an exact string match, so e.g.
#: /etc/NetworkManager and /var/lib/anything are refused too, not just
#: /etc and /var themselves. "/" itself is handled separately (every path
#: is "under" the filesystem root, so it can't be part of this list without
#: rejecting everything). "/root" is included here (nesting always
#: rejected) because it is only ever meaningful as the root *user's* home,
#: not a normal install location.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT in this list, because a real install/cache folder can
#: legitimately live nested underneath them: "/home" (its own
#: exact-match-only check lives further down, alongside the logic that
#: rejects other users' home trees at any depth), "/tmp" (used by the app's
#: own temp/staging paths and test fixtures), and "/mnt"/"/media" (the
#: conventional place to install a large modpack to an external/secondary
#: drive).
