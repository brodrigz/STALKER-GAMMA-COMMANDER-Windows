"""Game launching: detect the runner and launch Mod Organizer / the game.

GAMMA is a Windows mod pack run through Mod Organizer 2 (MO2). On Linux the
CLI wiki recommends running ``gamma/ModOrganizer.exe`` inside a Proton/Wine
prefix. This module detects the most common setups:

* Steam/UMU: ``umu-run`` with the default ``~/Games/umu/umu-default`` prefix,
  optionally wrapped in ``gamemoderun`` (the recommended path).
* Steam Proton: any Proton version installed via Steam is discovered
  (``steamapps/common/Proton*``) and launched with ``proton run <exe>``.
* Plain Wine: ``wine`` with an optional explicit ``WINEPREFIX``.

The game is launched through MO2's ``run -e <title>`` command so the virtual
file system is active and all GAMMA mods are loaded.

    Checks byte identity against every Wine installed on the *host*
    (``host_wine_lib_dirs()``), not against the selected runner's own copy.
    That distinction is the whole point: switching from one Proton build to
    another in the same prefix is completely normal - Proton re-syncs its
    own files on the next launch and nothing crashes from it - so a prefix
    carrying a *different Proton build's* ntdll must never be flagged here.

    a Lutris runner) is the real hazard this exists to catch: that is what a

    behind, and it is what makes every process fault on its first thread.

    An earlier version of this function compared against the selected
    runner's own ntdll instead, which flagged a perfectly healthy prefix as
    corrupted the moment the user picked a different (but equally valid)
    Proton build - refusing a launch, and the Repair Prefix action, that had

    Only ntdll is checked: it is the one file that cannot be wrong without

    Proton's normal state for DLLs it does not copy.
